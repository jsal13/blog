# July 2024

I like to keep to a schedule as best I can.  On work days I:

- Wake up
- Make some [green tea](https://www.adagio.com/green/dragon_pearl.html)
- Read through my emails and slack messages
- Open my todo list and Jira board (which is my "work todo list")
- Make a plan for the rest of the day

In the last year I've gotten back into RSS feeds as a news aggregator.  Weekdays I'll get around 120 articles.  Of these,

- Around 40 have an interesting or informative headline
- Of those 40, around 15 are worth skimming or listening to
- Of these 15, around 1 or 2 are worth a full read

When I give something a full read it's probably going to be something I want to share --- not only because I want others to read it, but also because it helps _me_ learn and remember whatever content is in the article.  Sometimes it's a catchy song, sometimes it's a cool tutorial, sometimes it's a neat piece of technology.  Who knows.

I decided to post an aggregate of the "full reads" by month.  It's easiest for me to jot things down in markdown and pop it into github so that's why it looks like this.

Thank you for reading, I hope you find something cool.

- 🎸 [Juliaplaysgroove's Bass Cover of "Good Luck, Babe!" by Chappell Roan](https://youtu.be/_LBMgiJQelA?si=fOLKG1r7a8l0_EHU): Polish bassist, youtube superstar, and general bad-ass Julia Przybysz picks up her fretless and covers that one song that you heard at least twenty times during the Pride Parade.  Love it.

- ✏️ [Modus Tollens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens)

    I was editing a story someone had written and there was a back-and-forth like this:

    > "If a great carpenter builds a house it will never collapse."
    >
    > "But our house is completely demolished!"
    >
    > "Right.  I'm not a great carpenter."

    I remembered a long time ago taking a logic class where we did rules of inference; this line closely resembles _Modus Tollens_ ("_modus tollendo tollens_": "method of removing by taking away").  The formal statement of _modus tollens_ is $$P\to Q,\neg P\therefore \neg Q$$.

    One example closer to the actual rule is something like: "If Anne is with Beth, Anne will be happy.  Anne is not happy.  It must be the case that Anne is not with Beth."  Poor Anne.

- 💻 [The Polyfill Issue](https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack)

    When I have an app or a site I always want to get to "inbox zero" on warnings and errors.  I noticed when trying to tweak Mathjax (a Math symbol rendering library for browsers which made the P->Q thing in the previous link) I was getting a "cdn.polyfill.io name not resolved" issue.  _Curious_, I thought, _but I have no idea what polyfill even_ is.  

    I googled it and found that, in February 2024, the cdn.polyfill.io domain and github account were sold to a Chinese company; on June 25, 2024, cdn.polyfill.io began injecting malware into polyfill.js.  Mathjax had included using polyfill in copy+paste examples in their documentation but decided to [simply remove it with no replacement](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/issues/334) as nearly all browsers already support ES6 and that was all that they were using polyfill for.  **tl;dr: If your website uses polyfill it's probably best to remove it or use a [safe alternative](https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540)**.

- 📊 [How to Move From pandas to Polars @ Jetbrains](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/06/how-to-move-from-pandas-to-polars/): a guest post by Cheuk Ting Ho on how to migrate from pandas to Polars.  **If you haven't tried out Polars and you're a pandas user, check this noise out.**  I switched over a few months ago and have found it to be much faster and much less annoying to use (looking at you, pandas indexing).

- 📊 [The Meaning of Explainability for AI](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-meaning-of-explainability-for-ai-d8ae809c97fa): Explainability in AI, posted by the ever-interesting data science pro, Stephanie Kirmer.

- [Jerome Robbins' The Concert: Mistake Waltz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0axUoy4wbQ):  (3 mins) Watched this for a comedy Burlesque class --- it's about how it's okay to make errors and you can easily turn this into a nice thing by either making it a "wink" to the audience or by doubling down.  Neat stuff.
