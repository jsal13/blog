# July 2024

I like to keep to a schedule as best I can.  On work days I'll wake up, make some [green tea](https://www.adagio.com/green/dragon_pearl.html), read through my emails and slack messages, open my todo list and my Jira board (which is my "work todo list") and make a plan for the rest of the day.

In the last year I've gotten back into RSS feeds and added them to my post-morning routine: I'll typically scroll through my subscription list and open anything that looks cool and _Mark Read_ otherwise.  Weekdays I'll get around 120 articles: around 40 of these are worth reading the headline and, of these, around 10 are worth skimming or listening to (some are song debuts or youtube videos) and, of these, 1 or 2 are worth a serious read.

When I give something a "serious read" it's probably going to be something I want to share.  I kept trying to make a list of posts to share but I ran into two issues: I had too few posts to do a daily or weekly aggregation, and I had no place to share them that _felt_ good.  

I decided to aggregate by month, and I decided to do it in this form for now.  It's easiest for me to jot things down in markdown and pop it into github.

Thank you for reading, I hope you find something cool.

- 🎸 [Juliaplaysgroove's Bass Cover of "Good Luck, Babe!" by Chappell Roan](https://youtu.be/_LBMgiJQelA?si=fOLKG1r7a8l0_EHU): Polish bass player and youtube superstar Julia Przybysz picks up her fretless and covers that catchy ABBA-ish song that you heard at least twenty times during the Pride Parade.  Love it.
