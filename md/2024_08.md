- 🎸 [Jordana - Like A Dog (Official Music Video)](https://youtu.be/ut7VtQGJHzE?si=KVXzfMSJ9zDdOuVQ): Jordana's bedroom-pop feel and _weird energy_ make this a delight to listen to.  Love it.

- 🎸 [Billy Strings - Leadfoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJudzjpi1w): Famed bluegrasser and master banjo finger-picker Billy Strings put out a new song it's catchy as hell.  Big Primus energy.

- 📊 [DBT Docs: Data Spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source): An incredible boon that I learned about recently.  From the docs,

> This macro returns the sql required to build a date spine. The spine will include the start_date (if it is aligned to the datepart), but it will not include the end_date.

```sql
{{ dbt_utils.date_spine(
    datepart="day",
    start_date="cast('2019-01-01' as date)",
    end_date="cast('2020-01-01' as date)"
   )
}}
```

- 📊 [DBT Blog: In defense of group by 1](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1): An interesting argument for the use of `group by 1` instead of using column names.
