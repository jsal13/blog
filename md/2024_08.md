- 🎸 [Jordana - Like A Dog (Official Music Video)](https://youtu.be/ut7VtQGJHzE?si=KVXzfMSJ9zDdOuVQ): Jordana's bedroom-pop feel and _weird energy_ make this a delight to listen to.  Love it.

- 🎸 [Billy Strings - Leadfoot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBJudzjpi1w): Famed bluegrasser and master banjo finger-picker Billy Strings put out a new song it's catchy as hell.  Big Primus energy.

- 📊 [DBT Docs: Data Spine](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#date_spine-source): An incredible boon that I learned about recently.  From the docs,

> This macro returns the sql required to build a date spine. The spine will include the start_date (if it is aligned to the datepart), but it will not include the end_date.

```sql
{{ dbt_utils.date_spine(
    datepart="day",
    start_date="cast('2019-01-01' as date)",
    end_date="cast('2020-01-01' as date)"
   )
}}
```

- 📊 [DBT Blog: In defense of group by 1](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/write-better-sql-a-defense-of-group-by-1): An interesting argument for the use of `group by 1` instead of using column names.

- 🎸 [Ulysses Owens Jr. & Generation Y: “Heart-Shaped Box” (Jazz Cover)](https://www.notreble.com/buzz/2024/08/19/ulysses-owens-jr-generation-y-heart-shaped-box-jazz-cover/): Going from first listen of a song to a jazz cover in like a minute.  Incredible.

- ✏️ [What do you mean, most submissions are rejected on page 1? Isn’t that a trifle…judgmental?](https://www.annemini.com/2009/01/05/what-do-you-mean-most-submissions-are-rejected-on-page-1-isnt-that-a-triflejudgmental/revision-to-improve-your-books-chances/agency-screeners-pet-peeves-of-the-notorious-variety/): If you've critiqued or gotten critiques on writing these things will be familiar to you.  This is a great read to know what people scoff at in the traditional publishing industry.  A lot of it it is _very_ specific to trad publishing but there's a lot in there that is useful even for the amateur or self-pub author.  I dig it.
