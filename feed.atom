                <p>In the last year I've gotten back into RSS feeds as a news aggregator.
                    Sometimes I want to share things. Here's a monthly aggregate of my
                    favorite stuff. I hope you find something cool!</p>

                        <p>I was editing a story someone had written and there was a
                            back-and-forth like this:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"If a great carpenter builds a house it will never collapse."</p>
                            <p>"But our house is completely demolished!"</p>
                            <p>"Right. I'm not a great carpenter."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>I remembered a long time ago taking a logic class where we did rules of
                            inference; this line closely resembles <em>Modus
                                Tollens</em> ("<em>modus tollendo tollens</em>": "method of removing
                            by taking away"). The formal statement of <em>modus
                                tollens</em> is $$P\to Q,\neg P\therefore \neg Q$$.</p>
                        <p>One example closer to the actual rule is something like: "If Anne
                            is with Beth, Anne will be happy. Anne is not happy. It must be
                            the case that Anne is not with Beth." Poor Anne.</p>

                            Polyfill Issue</a></p>
                        <p>When I have an app or a site I always want to get to "inbox zero" on
                            warnings and errors. I noticed when trying to tweak Mathjax (a Math
                            symbol rendering library for browsers which made the P-&gt;Q thing in
                            the previous link) I was getting a "cdn.polyfill.io name not resolved"
                            issue. <em>Curious</em>, I thought, <em>but I have no idea what polyfill
                            even</em> is. </p>
                        <p>I googled it and found that, in February 2024, the cdn.polyfill.io domain
                            and github account were sold to a Chinese company; on June 25, 2024,
                            cdn.polyfill.io began injecting malware into polyfill.js. Mathjax had
                            included using polyfill in copy+paste examples in their documentation
                            but decided to <a

                            ES6 and that was all that they were using polyfill for. <strong>tl;dr:

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The GIL is a major obstacle to concurrency. For scientific computing
                        tasks, this lack of concurrency is often a bigger issue than speed
                        of executing Python code, since most of the processor cycles are
                        spent in optimized CPU or GPU kernels. The GIL introduces a global
                        bottleneck that can prevent other threads from making progress if
                        they call any Python code.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>From the article, looks like the major hurdles are to try to get
                    C-related stuff to play nice. It will be nice having this option since,
                    as the article notes, CPUs are currently better at scaling horizontally
                    (more cores) than vertically (better, faster cores).</p>

                        Owens Jr. &amp; Generation Y: ‚ÄúHeart-Shaped Box‚Äù (Jazz Cover)</a>: Going from first listen of a
                    song to a jazz cover in like a minute. Incredible.</p>

                    amateur or self-pub author. I dig it.</p>
