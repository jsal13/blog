<p>In the last year I've gotten back into RSS feeds as a news aggregator.  Sometimes I want to share things.  Here's a monthly aggregate of my favorite stuff.  I hope you find something cool!</p>

<p>🎸 <a href="https://youtu.be/_LBMgiJQelA?si=fOLKG1r7a8l0_EHU">Juliaplaysgroove's Bass Cover of "Good Luck, Babe!" by Chappell Roan</a>: Polish bassist, youtube superstar, and general bad-ass Julia Przybysz picks up her fretless and covers that one song that you heard at least twenty times during the Pride Parade.  Love it.</p>

<p>✏️ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens">Modus Tollens</a></p>
<p>I was editing a story someone had written and there was a back-and-forth like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If a great carpenter builds a house it will never collapse."</p>
<p>"But our house is completely demolished!"</p>
<p>"Right.  I'm not a great carpenter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remembered a long time ago taking a logic class where we did rules of inference; this line closely resembles <em>Modus Tollens</em> ("<em>modus tollendo tollens</em>": "method of removing by taking away").  The formal statement of <em>modus tollens</em> is $$P\to Q,\neg P\therefore \neg Q$$.</p>
<p>One example closer to the actual rule is something like: "If Anne is with Beth, Anne will be happy.  Anne is not happy.  It must be the case that Anne is not with Beth."  Poor Anne.</p>

<p>💻 <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">The Polyfill Issue</a></p>
<p>When I have an app or a site I always want to get to "inbox zero" on warnings and errors.  I noticed when trying to tweak Mathjax (a Math symbol rendering library for browsers which made the P-&gt;Q thing in the previous link) I was getting a "cdn.polyfill.io name not resolved" issue.  <em>Curious</em>, I thought, <em>but I have no idea what polyfill even</em> is.  </p>
<p>I googled it and found that, in February 2024, the cdn.polyfill.io domain and github account were sold to a Chinese company; on June 25, 2024, cdn.polyfill.io began injecting malware into polyfill.js.  Mathjax had included using polyfill in copy+paste examples in their documentation but decided to <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/issues/334">simply remove it with no replacement</a> as nearly all browsers already support ES6 and that was all that they were using polyfill for.  <strong>tl;dr: If your website uses polyfill it's probably best to remove it or use a <a href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">safe alternative</a></strong>.</p>

From PEP-703:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The GIL is a major obstacle to concurrency. For scientific computing tasks, this lack of concurrency is often a bigger issue than speed of executing Python code, since most of the processor cycles are spent in optimized CPU or GPU kernels. The GIL introduces a global bottleneck that can prevent other threads from making progress if they call any Python code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the article, looks like the major hurdles are to try to get C-related stuff to play nice.  It will be nice having this option since, as the article notes, CPUs are currently better at scaling horizontally (more cores) than vertically (better, faster cores).</p>
