<p>I like to keep to a schedule as best I can.  On work days I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up</li>
<li>Make some <a href="https://www.adagio.com/green/dragon_pearl.html">green tea</a></li>
<li>Read through my emails and slack messages</li>
<li>Open my todo list and Jira board (which is my "work todo list")</li>
<li>Make a plan for the rest of the day</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last year I've gotten back into RSS feeds as a news aggregator.  Weekdays I'll get around 120 articles.  Of these,</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 40 have an interesting or informative headline</li>
<li>Of those 40, around 15 are worth skimming or listening to</li>
<li>Of these 15, around 1 or 2 are worth a full read</li>
</ul>
<p>When I give something a full read it's probably going to be something I want to share --- not only because I want others to read it, but also because it helps <em>me</em> learn and remember whatever content is in the article.  Sometimes it's a catchy song, sometimes it's a cool tutorial, sometimes it's a neat piece of technology.  Who knows.</p>
<p>I decided to post an aggregate of the "full reads" by month.  It's easiest for me to jot things down in markdown and pop it into github so that's why it looks like this.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, I hope you find something cool.</p>

<p>‚úèÔ∏è <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens">Modus Tollens</a></p>
<p>I was editing a story someone had written and there was a back-and-forth like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If a great carpenter builds a house it will never collapse."</p>
<p>"But our house is completely demolished!"</p>
<p>"Right.  I'm not a great carpenter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remembered a long time ago taking a logic class where we did rules of inference; this line closely resembles <em>Modus Tollens</em> ("<em>modus tollendo tollens</em>": "method of removing by taking away").  The formal statement of <em>modus tollens</em> is $$P\to Q,\neg P\therefore \neg Q$$.</p>
<p>One example closer to the actual rule is something like: "If Anne is with Beth, Anne will be happy.  Anne is not happy.  It must be the case that Anne is not with Beth."  Poor Anne.</p>

<p>üíª <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">The Polyfill Issue</a></p>
<p>When I have an app or a site I always want to get to "inbox zero" on warnings and errors.  I noticed when trying to tweak Mathjax (a Math symbol rendering library for browsers which made the P-&gt;Q thing in the previous link) I was getting a "cdn.polyfill.io name not resolved" issue.  <em>Curious</em>, I thought, <em>but I have no idea what polyfill even</em> is.  </p>
<p>I googled it and found that, in February 2024, the cdn.polyfill.io domain and github account were sold to a Chinese company; on June 25, 2024, cdn.polyfill.io began injecting malware into polyfill.js.  Mathjax had included using polyfill in copy+paste examples in their documentation but decided to <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/issues/334">simply remove it with no replacement</a> as nearly all browsers already support ES6 and that was all that they were using polyfill for.  <strong>tl;dr: If your website uses polyfill it's probably best to remove it or use a <a href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">safe alternative</a></strong>.</p>
