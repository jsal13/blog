        <h1>The Elasticsearch Tutorial: Part 5, Chatbot Example</h1>
<!-- ID: 0050 -->
<p>Last Updated: <em>2024-02-29</em></p>
<hr />
<p>These will be a continuation of notes from doing the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/search-tutorial/welcome">elasticsearch tutorial</a>.  This will be written as I go so that you can go on this <code>journey</code> with me.</p>
<p>This time I'll be going through the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/chatbot-tutorial/chatbot-rag-app/setup">chatbot tutorial</a>.</p>
<h2>Preperation</h2>
<p>The first few pages of the chatbot tutorial tells me to download the repo (<code>git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs</code>), make a virtual env for python, (<code>python3 -m venv .venv; source .venv/bin/activate;</code>) and install the packages (<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>).  Nothing wild so far!</p>
<p><strong>A mini-adventure</strong>: I was at Starbucks before a class when I was cloning the repo and the wifi there isn't great.  It refused to download beyond 1%.  I tried to use the <code>--depth=1</code> <a href="https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/">flag</a> and after 4% I got a different error message:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>error:<span class="w"> </span>RPC<span class="w"> </span>failed<span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span>curl<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">16</span><span class="w"> </span>Error<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">in</span><span class="w"> </span>the<span class="w"> </span>HTTP2<span class="w"> </span>framing<span class="w"> </span>layer

fetch-pack:<span class="w"> </span>unexpected<span class="w"> </span>disconnect<span class="w"> </span><span class="k">while</span><span class="w"> </span>reading<span class="w"> </span>sideband<span class="w"> </span>packet

fatal:<span class="w"> </span>fetch-pack:<span class="w"> </span>invalid<span class="w"> </span>index-pack<span class="w"> </span>output
</code></pre></div>

<p>Huh.  That's a new one.  I found <a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/48568#discussioncomment-5108608">this answer</a> and decided to reset my wifi connection.  Nothing.  I decided to turn the wifi off and on again.  Nothing.  I decided to restart my laptop and &mdash; something!  The download sped to 81% and... failure.  One more time.  It looked like it got to 100% but gave me an error:</p>

    <figcaption>Oh come on!</figcaption>

<p>As I was writing up this part of the blog I tried one last time and finally &mdash; finally! &amp;mdash it finished and I had a shallow clone of the repo!  That ends that mini-advnture.  Surely, installing the Python packages will go smoother &mdash;</p>
<!-- ## Next Time

The next thing that the tutorial recommends doing is a [Chatbot Tutorial](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/chatbot-tutorial/welcome).  Since this tutorial goes over the [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/) project and works with some concepts I'm not familiar with, I think it might be fun to try out.

See you there! -->
